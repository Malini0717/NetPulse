### Real-Time Network Stability Monitor

**NetPulse** visualizes how stable your internet connection actually is — beyond traditional speed tests.

It measures **latency**, **jitter**, and **packet loss** in real time and combines them into an easy-to-understand **network stability score**, shown on a live web dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Live latency measurement (ms)
- Jitter detection (delay variation)
- Packet loss monitoring (%)
- Stability score with status: **GOOD / MODERATE / POOR**
- Real-time web dashboard

---

## 🧠 Why NetPulse?
Speed tests show how fast the internet *can be*.  
NetPulse shows how the internet *behaves*.

This explains video call lag, game jitter, and unstable connections that speed tests miss.
